This problem is basically do what it says. Compute the function 3n+1 for each value belongs to the input interval.
Then, find the maximum of these values. Because of the recursive nature of the function, a few values would be
computed many times. Therefore, we need to store previous computation of the function while we are trying to compute the
function for new values. This task is performed by collatz function. This function takes a natural number n and compute the
complete sequence given by the 3n+1 function taking into account a parameter that keeps previous results of 3n+1 function.
Then, this function returns a list of pairs, the number n and the length of the sequence for this n, and then, the same per each
number found into the sequence for the number n.
